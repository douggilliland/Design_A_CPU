== Design a CPU - Assembly Language Code Examples ==

* These are the assembly language code examples for the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtEJHF-pVU0&list=PLn__0BqzWEWNspQ0xkG5h-oSJ21EAet8H YouTube Video Series]
* The code examples are not necessarily forward compatible
** Some facilites, like the pushbutton are used as a general purpose pushbutton in earlier Test code but are re-purposed in later examples
** There are complete branches for each of the examples.
* Some of the examples were misnumbered.
** The videos take note of the error.
* If you pull the CPU tip things are newer and may have changed vs prior builds.

=== Assembler / Windows executable ===

* The CPU has an Assembler
** cpu_001 Assembler
* The assembler source files have to be saved as CSV files with a very specific first line
** This made the assembler much easier to write and code entry is much less error prone
** Assumes everyone has a spreadsheet program that can deal with CSV files
*** I use Calc in LibreOffice
* The Assembler is written in Python 3
* There's also a Windows executable if you don't have Python 3 installed on your computer
* Windows executable is [https://github.com/douggilliland/Design_A_CPU/tree/main/Assembler/dist in this folder]
** Useful for people who don't have Python 3 installed

==== Assembler Options ====

* Input fileName.csv
** Input file is tightly constrained in CSV file
(( Input File Header has to be -
<pre>
['LABEL', 'OPCODE', 'REG_LABEL', 'OFFSET_ADDR', 'COMMENT']
</pre>
* Output files
** .mif file - Quartus II ROM Memory Initialization File
** .lst file - Listing file (with addresses)

== Assembler opcodes ==

<pre>
#	LRI - Load a register with an immediate value (byte)
#	SRL - Shift register left
#	SRR - Shift register right
#	RRL - Rotate register left
#	RRR - Rotate register right
#	IOW - Write a register to an I/O address
#	IOR - Read an I/O address to a register
#	ORI - OR a register with an immediate value
#	ARI - AND a register with an immediate value
#	JSR - Jump to a subroutine (single level only)
#	RTS - Return from subroutine
#	BEZ - Branch if equal to zero
#	BNZ - Branch if not equal to zero
#	JMP - Jump to an address
#
# Assembler Psuedo-opcodes
#	NOP - No operation
#	HLT - Halt (Jump to self)
#	BEQ - Branch if equal (same as BEZ)
#	BNE - Branch if not equal (Aame as BNZ)
</pre>

== Error Messages ==

<pre>
#	Error messages are pretty rudimentary.
#	Error messages are printed to the command window.
#	The line with the error is printed as a list of the line.
#	Missing labels are presented as a message.
# 	Only one error at a time is presented.
#
</pre>

== Hardware Target ==

* The CPU could easily be run on pretty much any FPGA. 
* The targetted hardware is the [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33007471265.html?spm=a2g0o.store_pc_groupList.8148356.5.2f5a77a2912sNP QMTECH EP4CE15 FPGA card].
** This FPGA is inexpensive and powerful.
** The CPU takes up very little of the resources of the FPGA.
