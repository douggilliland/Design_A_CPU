=== VHDL Code ===

* VHDL code to "automatically" talk to [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Front_Panel_For_8_Bit_Computers Front Panel]
* Reads 32 pushbuttons
* Witers 32 LEDs

=== Programming tools ===

* CSV fils(s) driven
* Assembler - low level code
* Compiler - Macro language

=== IOP16  ===

IOP16 - I/O Processor with minimal instruction set

* 16-bit instruction code
* 12-bits address (up to 4096 instructions stored in FPGA ROM)
* Useful for for polled I/O
* 8 registers (8-bits) (read/write) for parameters/data
** Reserved space in instruction for 16 of 8-bit registers
* 8-bit data and address peripheral interface
** Controls up to 256 peripherals

==== Opcodes ====

* NOP - x0 - No Operation - Increments PC
* LRI - x2 - Load register with immediate value
* IOR - x6 - I/O Read into register
* IOW - x7 - I/O Write from register
* ARI - x8 - AND register with Immediate value and store back into register
* ORI - x9 - OR register with Immediate value and store back into register
* BEZ - xc - Branch by offset if equal to zero
* BNZ - xd - Branch by offset if not equal to zero
* JMP - xe - Jump to address (12-bits)

==== Fields ====

* d15..d12 = opcode
* d11..d0  = 12-bit offset (BEZ, BNZ)
* d11..d0  = 12-bit address (JMP)
* d7..d0   = 8-bit address (IOR, IOW)
* d11..d8  = register number (LRI, IOR, IOW, ARI, ORI)
* d7..d0   = Immediate value (LRI, ARI, ORI)
