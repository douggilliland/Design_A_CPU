== UART ==

Interface mimics ACIA software interface address/control/status contents

* [http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/Notebook/Hardware_ACIA.pdf ACIA datasheet]

== Programming Interface ==

* Two addresses, Control/status and data access

=== Status Register ===

* Register Select = 0
* Read/Write = Read
** d0 = RDRF	= Receive Data Register Full (1 = data is ready to read)
** d1 = TDRE	= Transmit Data Register Empty (1 = transmit is ready to send out data)
** d2 = DCD		= Data Carrier Detect (0 = carrier present - hardwired)
** d3 = CTS		= Clear to Send (0 = Clear to Send - ready to accept data - hardwired)
** d7 = IRQ		= Interrupt Request (1 = Interrupt present)

===  Control Register ===

* Register Select = 0
* Read/Write = Write
** d1,d0		= Control (11 = Master Reset)
** d6,d5		= TC = Transmitter Control (RTS = Transmitter Interrupt Enable/Disable)
** d7 		= Interrupt Enable (1=enable interrupts)

=== Data Register ===

* Register Select = 1
** Read = Read data from the data register (not implemented due to kbd removal)
** Write = Write data to the data register
