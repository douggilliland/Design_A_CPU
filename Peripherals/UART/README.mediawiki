== UART ==

Interface mimics ACIA software interface address/control/status contents

=== UART Programming Interface ===

* Two addresses, Control/status and data access

==== Status Register (Read) ====

* Register Select = 0
* Bits
<pre>
d0 = RDRF	= Receive Data Register Full (1 = data is ready to read)
d1 = TDRE	= Transmit Data Register Empty (1 = transmit is ready to send out data)
d2 = DCD		= Data Carrier Detect (0 = carrier present - hardwired)
d3 = CTS		= Clear to Send (0 = Clear to Send - ready to accept data - hardwired)
d7 = IRQ		= Interrupt Request (1 = Interrupt present)
</pre>

====  Control Register (Write) ====

* Register Select = 0
* Bits
<pre>
d1,d0 = Control (11 = Master Reset)
d6,d5 = TC = Transmitter Control (RTS = Transmitter Interrupt Enable/Disable)
d7    = Interrupt Enable (1=enable interrupts)
</pre>

==== Data Register (Read/Write) ====

* Register Select = 1
** Read = Read data from the data register (not implemented due to kbd removal)
** Write = Write data to the data register
