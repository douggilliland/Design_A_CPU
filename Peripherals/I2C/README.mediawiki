== I2C Interface ==

* The I2C core provides register addresses that the CPU can read or written to:
** Address 0 -> DATA (write/read) or SLAVE ADDRESS (write)  
** Address 1 -> Command/Status Register (write/read)

=== Data Buffer (write/read) ===

* bit 7-0	= Stores I2C read/write data, or
* bit 7-1	= Holds the first seven address bits of the I2C slave device
* bit 0	= I2C 1:read/0:write bit

=== Command Register (write) ===

* bit 7-2	= Reserved
* bit 1-0
** 00: IDLE
** 01: START
** 10: nSTART
** 11: STOP

=== Status Register (read) ===

* bit 7-2	= Reserved
* bit 1 	= ERROR 	(I2C transaction error)
* bit 0 	= BUSY 	(I2C bus busy)

== Example (R32V2020) ==

<pre>
; Write 0x22 to IOCON register (not sequential operations)
START
 lix		r8,0x01
 bsr		write_I2C_Ctrl_Reg
; I2C Slave address
 lix		r8,0x40
 bsr		write_I2C_Data_Address_Reg
IDLE
 lix		r8,0x00
 bsr		write_I2C_Ctrl_Reg
; IO control register
 lix		r8,0x05
 bsr		write_I2C_Data_Address_Reg
; STOP
 lix		r8,0x03
 bsr		write_I2C_Ctrl_Reg	
; Disable sequential operation
 lix		r8,0x22
 bsr		write_I2C_Data_Address_Reg
</pre>
