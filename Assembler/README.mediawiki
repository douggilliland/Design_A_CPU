== Design a CPU - Assembler ==

The CPU has an Assembler.

== Assembler - Windows executable ==

* Windows executable is [https://github.com/douggilliland/Design_A_CPU/tree/main/Assembler/dist in this folder]
* Useful for people who don't have Python 3 installed
* Compiled to executable using
<pre>
pyinstaller --onefile pyAssemble_cpu_001.py
</pre>

== Documentation ==

# cpu_001 Assembler
# Assemble code for CPU
# 
# CPU is at
# 	https://github.com/douggilliland/Design_A_CPU/tree/main
#
# Input fileName.csv
# 	Input file is tightly constrained in CSV file
# 	Input File Header has to be -
#		['LABEL', 'OPCODE', 'REG_LABEL', 'OFFSET_ADDR', 'COMMENT']
#
# Output files
# 	.mif file - Quartus II ROM Memory Initialization File
#	.lst file - Listing file (with addresses)
#
# Assembler opcodes
#	LRI - Load a register with an immediate value (byte)
#	SRL - Shift register left
#	SRR - Shift register right
#	RRL - Rotate register left
#	RRR - Rotate register right
#	IOW - Write a register to an I/O address
#	IOR - Read an I/O address to a register
#	ORI - OR a register with an immediate value
#	ARI - AND a register with an immediate value
#	JSR - Jump to a subroutine (single level only)
#	RTS - Return from subroutine
#	BEZ - Branch if equal to zero
#	BNZ - Branch if not equal to zero
#	JMP - Jump to an address
#
# Assembler Psuedo-opcodes
#	NOP - No operation
#	HLT - Halt (Jump to self)
#	BEQ - Branch if equal (same as BEZ)
#	BNE - Branch if not equal (Aame as BNZ)
#
# Error Messages
#	Error messages are pretty rudimentary.
#	Error messages are printed to the command window.
#	The line with the error is printed as a list of the line.
#	Missing labels are presented as a message.
# 	Only one error at a time is presented.

== Hardware Target ==

* The CPU could easily be run on pretty much any FPGA. 
* The targetted hardware is the [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33007471265.html?spm=a2g0o.store_pc_groupList.8148356.5.2f5a77a2912sNP QMTECH EP4CE15 FPGA card].
** This FPGA is inexpensive and powerful.
** The CPU takes up very little of the resources of the FPGA.
